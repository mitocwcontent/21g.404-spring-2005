Erwerb neuen Vokabulars
-----------------------

On a daily basis you will write a 4-sentence summary of each assigned reading and 1 discussion question in your **Kladde** (8x11 notebook). In another section of your "Kladde" enter the 5 items of vocabulary selected by the class. Number the items consecutively, and for each item give lexical information, a synonym or short explanation in German, one or two words of the same etymological or semantic family, and your own sentence to illustrate usage (should refer to the readings). Learn this material thoroughly. Please bring your "Kladde" to class each day.

Prüfungen
---------

2 hour exams, 4 vocabulary quizzes (no final exam).

Endnote
-------

40% class participation (includes, written preparation, "Kladde" and active daily discussion), 30% essays, 30% tests. If, however, you fail any one of these categories you will necessarily fail the course.

Daily preparation and attendance is mandatory, more than three unexcused absences lowers participation grade automatically.

Ein Hinweis
-----------

There is a pedagogical reason for the strict and controlled organization of this course: the secret of success in foreign language acquisition lies in sustained daily effort, frequent practice, and constant repetition. Therefore, I will not accept late homework, including essays, unless you have gotten an extension from me beforehand. If an emergency situation or sleep deprivation should prevent you from preparing for class, don't stay away. Tell me at the beginning of class and we will try to make the best of the situation.
